Public Talk

Public Talk is a page simulating the public. 
As a remote event sketch I hope to express the possibility for the interaction window for those waiting for the train to animate on their phone.
The intention would be to make two channel available to participants. A channel for those waiting for the train and those picked up by the train.
This sketch is of the waiting and initial chat room before particpants get picked up on the other chat room.
